                        </h5>
                        <p class="aocPara3">
                            You should have experience of working with children, either as a nanny or in other childcare settings, 
                            as well as good organisational skills and the ability to cook.
                        </p>

                            Formal childcare qualifications are not needed though some clients do insist on this as part of their 
                            criteria. Some nannies do have childcare qualifications such as Cache, however some just have a good level 
                            of childcare experience, along with a paediatric first aid certificate and a <a href="#" style={{textDecoration: "none"}}>valid DBS.</a> Good references are

                            Live-in nannies do anything relating to the children. In addition, you should be prepared to help with 
                            things such as running errands, family shopping etc., and ensuring you are flexible.

                            What your day as a live-in nanny looks like will largely depend on the ages of the children you are working 
                            with. If there are older children who are at school and/or nursery then there may be time during the day 
                            for a break. However, if the role has younger children then it may be more difficult - in this case we 
                            encourage nannies to take a break when the children are napping.

                            Nannies are paid through a payroll company, such as NannyTax. Your salary is paid directly into your 
                            bank account, usually monthly.

                            Yes. In most households you get 28 days paid holidays per year inclusive of bank holidays. This is for 
                            nannies working a five-day week, if you work less days then the holiday will be calculated pro-rata however 
                            it is down to your employer and what is on your contract – flexibility is always important to ensure you 
                            and the family are in agreement as to when is the most convenient time for you to take holidays.

                            An au pair doesn’t necessarily have any previous childcare experience. Au pairs come to the UK to learn English/study so 
                            therefore can only work part-time and they rarely have childcare qualifications.
